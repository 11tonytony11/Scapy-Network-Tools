## Ping
Ping is command sending small packet of data to certain server. It is often used to make sure server is running and communicating. It is also used sometimes for DOS or DDOS attacks.

## NSlookup
NSlookup is a tool used to create a dns query. In simple word, it converts domain (e.g example.com) to ip (e.g 103.44.59.181). It is great command to detect DNS problems.

## Trace route
Trace route, also known as Tracert is used to check the path between the user and the server. it is used to diagnose causes for packet loss and connectivity issues.
