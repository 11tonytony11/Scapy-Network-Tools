# Scapy-Network-Tools
I am creating scapy-based open source program containing useful custom tools such as traceroute, ping and nslookup. In the future, I will create connectivity test that will help users to diagnose their network easier.

Currently I have created initial functions for nslookup, ping and tracert. GUI will be availabe soon.
